Face recognition is one of the most widely used in my application.

You also need to know the creation of pipeline architecture and call it from the client-side, HTTP request, and many more. While doing so you might face many challenges while developing the app. This course is structured in such a way that you can able to develop the face recognition based web app from scratch.
